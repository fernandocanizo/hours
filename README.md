# HoursJs

Simple script to add up hours.

I use it to count worked hours on each project.

Refer to the sample `worked.hours.txt` file to see the format.

*WIP* This is Work In Progress, so far it's just giving a partial report. Also
the format need more work as I need to discriminate between in-office hours
from remote hours. In-office hours have an extra hour added for lunch which
needs to be taken into account. Remote hours are pure worked hours.
